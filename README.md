Set Up:
1. Access Data folder stored on my drive. [ https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B5uGyLZooPKAEWKwljVcHHbr7ddmtfRM?usp=sharing ]. This make require direct sharing to your gmails but ive set it to anyone with link.
2. If you have space (around 7Gb) in drive, copy it to the root of your drive. if not then add a shortcut to it in <MyDrive> using the three dots option on it. This will let you access it in colab.
4. open up colab file [ https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AwUJ4jHhOjgO0vutg6jkg-_4aPRTlz8X?usp=sharing ].
5. open up terminal and clone the repository.
